/ Just a simple API. Your project         \
| directory should look as below. After   |
| npm install then node index.js, You     |
| should get an output according to       |
| output.png. The server is listening at  |
| port 9000. Try serving it an see the    |
| error. To see how the UI looks like     |
| rename index2.html to index.html, make  |
| sure you rename the original index.html |
| to something else. Both files are in    |
| the swagger UI folder.After that        |
| restart the server then explicitly to   |
| index.html right click and open with    |
| your prefered browser. Thats how it     |
| should look like. My problem is when    |
| you run locallhost:9000 it does not pic |
| the original index.html in the swagger  |
| UI folder as defined in lines 39 - 42   |
\ of the index.js file. Try helping       /
